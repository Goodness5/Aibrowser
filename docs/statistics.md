## Usage statistics collection in Min

By default, Min sends some statistics about how it's used. Currently, these include:

* Your operating system and computer language
* When you installed Min
* The version of Min that you're using
* How often you use certain features in Min
* An anonymous ID representing your installation of Min

Collecting this data allows us to prioritize which devices and operating systems we test and which features we work on.

Min does not send:
* Anything that can be used to personally identify you
* Any browsing history, passwords, or other data stored locally in Min

If you want to opt-out of statistics collection, you can do so by going to the preferences page within Min and de-selecting "send usage statistics".
